# Transpiler
Our project focuses on building a source-to-source transpiler that converts Python code into equivalent C++ code. The aim of our project is to process the translation of Python scripts into C++ while preserving itâ€™s original logic , structure, and functionality. This project is highly valuable for developers working across platforms, for performance enhancement, or for modernizing legacy codebases. The transpiler works in three phases: it first parses Python code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), then translates the AST into an Intermediate Representation (IR), and finally generates equivalent C++ code using a custom code generator. This modular and extensible approach ensures the addition of support for more features or languages in the future.
